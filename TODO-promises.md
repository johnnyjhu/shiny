# Promises TODO

- [x] How to handle invisible/withVisible? This is needed for dealing with ggplot2 in renderPlot.
- [x] renderPlot is broken. plotFunc is synchronous but calls func() which is potentially asynchronous.
- [ ] Brushing not working; the mapping is null for ggplot.
- [ ] ..stacktraceon../..stacktraceoff.. and stack traces in general
